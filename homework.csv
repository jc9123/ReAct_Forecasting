1,6902347,"How many dollars will the movie ""Mean Girls"" (the 2024 release) gross in the US on the weekend of Jan 26-28?
This will resolve based on Box Office Mojo's number for Jan 26-28 here: https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl615482113/weekend/?ref_=bo_rl_tab#tabs",We considered historical data for movies with the same number of weeks since release as a reference class and performed a linear regression.
1,1,"Will ""Mean Girls"" (the 2024 release) be the highest-grossing movie in the US on the weekend of Jan 26-28?
This will resolve based on this Box Office Mojo page: https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/?ref_=bo_nb_wey_secondarytab

Specifically, the question will resolve positively if the entry with row ""Jan 26-28"" and column ""#1 Release"" is ""Mean Girls,"" and negatively if that entry is another movie.","We considered other movies that were already out or about to release that may be likely to outcompete “Mean Girls” and determined that the only real contender was “Beekeeper.” Beekeeper had outperformed “Mean Girls” on Monday before the end of the forecasting period, which threw some uncertainty into our forecasts. Ultimately, the numbers were quite close."
2,88,"What will the RSF Weight Room Crowd Meter read next to ""% Full"" on Monday, February 5 at 8:30am Pacific Time? To clarify, we are interested in the number for ""Weight Rooms"" not for ""CMS Fitness.""

i.e. if the meter reads ""87% Full,"" the answer will be  ""87.""","We sampled the meter on several days at 8:30am to get a sense for how full the meter typically is at the given time.

We checked the weather forecast for the given day since we believe it to have an effect on the meter (i.e. lower if it rains).

We considered trends in the semester and that students may get busier in week 4, so we adjusted downward slightly.

We searched for historical data online and found some that we could use."
2,116600000,How many monthly listeners will the top artist on Spotify have on February 26th at 10am Pacific Time? This answer will resolve according to the number posted here: https://www.viberate.com/music-charts/top-artists-by-spotify-monthly-listeners/.,"We looked at the current and previous months’ numbers to get a ballpark sense of what it might become next month.

We checked past and upcoming releases of albums/singles that might’ve led (or will lead) to a spike in the numbers for a particular artist. The Weeknd (who was currently #1 at 115.9M) just released some songs with Madonna on Jan 26, 2024, which we thought could lead to a spike for Feb 2024.

We also looked at historical variability over past months to gauge how wide the confidence interval should be."
2,0,"Will the fastest finisher of the 2024 San Francisco Half Marathon have a ""Gun Elapsed"" time faster than the fastest ""Gun Elapsed"" time from the 2023 San Francisco Half Marathon (which was 1:07:22)?

This question will resolve based on the results posted here: https://results.svetiming.com/Pamakid/events/2024/san-francisco-half-marathon-10k--5K/results","Only a small handful of racers really have a reasonable shot at beating last year’s top time.

Games against the Suns

Curry’s past seasons

We considered how likely we thought Curry would be benched for rest and determined this probability was small enough not to include 0 in our intervals."
3,1,"Kanye West has pushed back the release of his album ""Vultures"" multiple times since its scheduled release. Will it be released by the end of February 2024?","We looked at past reasons why the album was delayed, which included sample clearance issues.

We read news that there is a listening party scheduled to take place in Chicago. The venue, United Center, had confirmed the release of the album.

The main question became whether there were past false release dates with sold out concerts.

We considered the fact that the album was previously pushed back as late as one day before the scheduled release. Given that the release is scheduled for 3 days from the end of the forecasting period, we thought there was still a reasonable chance that it gets pushed back.

We also considered that both Kanye and Ty Dolla Sign, who collaborated on the album, have posted teasers on social media."

4,,"Taylor Swift recently announced the release of her new album The Tortured Poets Department, which is scheduled for April 19, 2024. How many monthly listeners will she have on Spotify on April 26th, 2024?

This question will resolve based on the results shown at 2:45pm on April 26th, 2024 here: https://open.spotify.com/artist/06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02.","We studied the time series of her monthly listenership over the last 6-12 months, in the context of major events surrounding her (album releases, concert tour, movie release) and paid special attention to the trends one week after, since April 26th is one  week after he scheduled release of her next album. We found that 7 days following each of “Speak Now (TV)” and  “1989 (TV),"" there was roughly a 4.2% and 3.8% jump in her listenership. 

Next it remained to predict what her following would be on April 19, 2024 when the new album releases. We estimated her last 3 month average to be about 106.6 million followers and she has had a solid 100M for many months, so we expect it will be at least 100M, and likely 5-10M higher than that. Adding 4% to 106.6M gives a mean of 110.8M. We set our lower bound as 100M1.04=104M. For the upper bound, we also thought it is reasonable that she will break her all-time record as she has with her previous album releases, which means going over 111.1M. Her last album release had an 8.5% jump (took one month from the release date to reach it), so anything 8.5% above 111.1M (i.e. 120M) would be too high. Ultimately, we settled on an upper bound of 4% higher than her current all-time high, which is 111.1M1.04= 115.544M."
4,0,"Will SpaceX launch its rocket ""Starship""  in February 2024?

This question will resolve on March 1, 2024 according to data posted here: https://www.faa.gov/data_research/commercial_space_data. Specifically, this question will resolve positively if there is at least one row under ""Licensed Launches"" with a ""Launch Date (UTC)"" in February 2024, ""Operator"" as ""SpaceX,"" and ""Vehicle"" as ""Starship Super Heavy.""","Elon Musk tweeted on Monday that the launch would be in 3 weeks, which is outside of February. We believe that he tends to be over-ambitious as opposed to under-abitious, so already we believe that it is less than 50% likely that it will happen before the end of February. The question now becomes how much less likely than 50%?

We considered the days of the week of the previous launches and found that they were not on the same day of the week, so that doesn’t necessarily give us much information about what day of the week the next launch might be on. (SpaceX has also launched other vehicles on all days of the week).

Launch 1 was on Thursday, April 20, 2023.

Launch 2 was on Saturday, November 18, 2023.

On the FAA site, we found data on the launch license for this vehicle. We observed that these licenses seem to get revised before each launch, and the last revision was 3 days before launch 2. 

​​Elon Musk tweeted five days before the second launch, saying the FAA had given the license for it. He was 1-day over-ambitious in saying they would launch Nov 17, but it was actually Nov 18. Source

Under the assumption that we’d see a revised launch license before the launch and perhaps a tweet from Elon Musk ~ 5 days before, that leaves 10-12 viable days before the end of February on which the launch could take place. Combined with a lack of other public information, it seems plausible that the license + announcement of the launch date comes rather rapidly. Ultimately, we were not comfortable putting a probability as low as 0.1, and something as high as 0.3 felt a little too high, so we went with 0.2.

We also considered the weather and found that the site in Texas where the previous launches took place had no signs of severely bad weather. This made it still plausible that the launch could happen in February, and ultimately did not affect our forecast that much."
5,1909,"What will be the attendance of the Cal Women's Basketball game against Arizona (currently scheduled for February 25th, 2024 at noon)?

This question will resolve based on the attendance figure posted to espn.com after the game (i.e. here: https://www.espn.com/womens-college-basketball/game/_/gameId/401609736/arizona-california)

Clarifications:
In case the game is rescheduled, attendance will be taken from the rescheduled game.
If the game is not played by the end of April 26th, 2024, this question will resolve as 0.","We based our forecast on the quantiles (0.1 and 0.9) of the empirical distribution from the last 2 seasons, filtered to exclude winter break.We also excluded the attendances vs USC, Stanford, and UCLA since we believe those to be uncharacteristic for this game, since those are three opponents that typically draw larger crowds.

We did not include 0 in our confidence interval because we believe that the probability of a cancelation/postponement past the resolution date was lower than 10% (the lower extreme beyond our confidence interval).

We also considered variation year-over-year, but decided this was probably negligible."
5,570,"What will be the sum of the durations, in minutes, of the films that win the following awards at the 96th Academy Awards?
Best picture
Best actress
Best animated feature film
Best original song
Best animated short film
For example, if ""American Fiction"" (117 min) wins best best picture, Annette Bening from ""Nyad"" (121 min) wins best actress, ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" (140 min) wins best animated feature film, ""What Was I Made For?"" from ""Barbie"" (114 min) wins best original song, and ""Our Uniform"" (7 min) wins best animated short film, then the answer would resolve as 117+121+140+114+7=499.

Clarifications:
Durations will be taken as listed on imdb.com.
In case the same movie wins for multiple of the categories listed above, its duration will count that many times toward the sum.
In case of a tie for any particular category, the duration for that category will be taken as the mean of those involved in the tie.
In case of no winner for a particular category (i.e. if the category is suddenly removed), the duration will be 0 for that category.

5,12,"How many students will have a score higher than that of the trimmed mean in the class forecasting competition as of March 1st, 2024?

This question will resolve based on the results posed to the leaderboard. Course staff will update the leaderboard on March 1 before resolving this question. To avoid giving staff an advantage, course staff will pick future HW prediction questions that will resolve after March 1st, 2024.","Looking at https://js-d-leaderboard-s23-streamlit-app-kmv5je.streamlit.app/ (sp23 leaderboard) we see that at the end of the semester, the Trimmed mean of predictions beats out everyone. I now do a more depth analysis using previous year numbers but a decent prior is that it should monotonically decrease from the 22 it is at now with a trimmed mean of 0.839881, leading to [0, 22] as a very wide 95% CI.

We then looked through past homeworks from https://stat157.com and found https://js-d-leaderboard-streamlit-app-x0qnz0.streamlit.app/ which further lent credence to the trimmed mean beating everyone.

Using the bootstrap feature on the website, we found [11, 24] to be a decent measure of spread within the respective dates, averaged from the average of weeks 1 to 5 and from weeks 1 to 6."

6,111839191,"How many views will Mr. Beast's most recent YouTube video have, as of April 12, 2024 at 2:30pm PT?

Clarifications:
Counts only videos available on the Mr. Beast main channel at the resolution date/time.
Videos that are taken down as of the resolution date do not count.

We knew that he releases on Saturdays from #84bbe
We mostly based our forecasts on past data of his viewership. We used the website in #84bba. He consistently gets 90M+ fairly quickly on new videos which gives a good ballpark of the lower bound. We also looked at the highest amount he has gotten recently and this gave a good ballpark for the upper bound.

We considered weather as a potential deterrent but long range forecasts said it is predicted to be sunny (62 degrees, source) with no rain in that week

We considered the effect of the time of day and decided that although 1pm is around lunchtime, it will not affect things that much (based on prior knowledge of tabling)

7,18007.5,"In the Reykjavik Open 2024 chess tournament, what will be the product of the top 5 players' scores at the end of the 9th round (currently scheduled for March 15-21, 2024)? Scoring in chess is computed as follows: 0 points for a loss, 0.5 points for a draw, 1 point for a win.

Included a point mass at the extrapolated value from today using a first order forecast

See squiggle link

Observed that this year is at a higher pace than previous (~784 per day vs. 721/day and 452/day)

This year is probably more similar to last year, based on recency

Observed that the cumulative value we are forecasting has some “big hitters” from big companies with a lot of layoffs at once (500-5000 at a time). This could cause the final value to be higher than expected, so airing on the high side seems advisable.

“Other options” like a huge recession or uncharacteristically massive wave of layoffs seems negligibly unlikely in the given time frame."

Biden is in an election year and we’ve noticed that he’s on a current downwards trend and that momentum may be hard to break (he’s already gone a good amount up and it’s unlikely for him to convince anyone since most of his problems stem from old-age so we pretty much expect his popularity to decrease, with some variance) so we adjust wider downwards.

Resolution Criteria:

Resolves shortly after 3/20 with results posted here.
If results are not posted by April 26th, 2024, this question will resolve to 0.","Some high level considerations:

Number of pieces: 64

We looked at past auctions to get a sense of how often items sold within their estimated range and how often they were extremely far below or above

~10% seemed to not sell

~⅓ went much higher than their range (10-100% higher than their range)

About 10% sold far below their range

Squiggle rough sketch of distribution

Adjusted upper bound upward by about 50% since that seemed reasonable based on the findings above.

Adjusted lower bound interval downward to hedge against the consideration that ~20% usually went for lower than their value/did not sell.

In hindsight, we should have had a better model to account for the proportion of pieces that actually get sold."
