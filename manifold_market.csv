This market will resolves using the official Manifold Leaderboard: Top Traders of All Time OR using the ""Trading profits"" value from the profile page of the user in question. 


Caveats:
1. Several people have to confirm in the comments that the resolution criteria are met. A photoshoped screenshot wold not trigger the resolution.
2. Any single point on the personal ""Trading profits"" graph that is Ṁ2,000,000 or more is sufficient for the YES resolution. A ""weird profit spike"" still counts.
3. If Manifold admins discontinue the Leaderboard feature (it's no longer available through any link) this market resolves N/A regardless if the total profits value is still displayed on the profile page.
4. If Manifold admins rollback the windfall profits from the self-resolving markets (like the WvM) this market still resolves acording to the resolution criteria above.
5. Intentional total profit value manipulation by strategic betting by anyone will not be disqualified, and this market still resolves acording to the resolution criteria above.
6. Intentional total profit value manipulation using bugs / alt-accounts / bots / or fake accounts WILL be disqualified provided sufficient proof, and this market will close, untill the admins take necessary actions and/or rollback the exploited profits, and only after that the market will be reopened. If this market is ever resolved as YES by mistake and later admins ban the user or rollback the exploited profits this market will re-resolve as N/A.
7. In case of a dispute the poll will be held on how this market should resolve.
8. Any value on any profit graph before May 1st 2023 will not trigger the resolution.


This list of caveats might change based on the feedback in the comment section.

Prediction Market Title:


""Will Apple Announce Direct Web Downloads for Apps in the US by April 30th, 2024?""


Introduction:


Apple has made a significant concession in Europe by allowing developers to distribute apps directly to consumers, a move to comply with the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA). This decision marks a potential shift in Apple's long-standing App Store policies, which have been a major source of revenue for the company.

Example Headlines for YES Resolution:


""Apple Announces Developers Can Now Offer Apps Directly to Consumers in the US""


""Apple Expands Direct App Downloads to US Users, Breaking from App Store Exclusivity""


""Following EU Policy, Apple Opens Up Direct App Distribution in the United States""

""Apple Adjusts US App Store Policy, Allows Direct Web Downloads for Apps""


Example Edge Cases for NO Resolution:


""Apple Considers Direct App Downloads in the US, No Official Policy Change Announced""


""Apple to Study the Impact of EU's DMA Act Before Deciding on US App Distribution""


""Rumors of Apple Allowing Direct App Downloads in the US, Company Remains Silent""

""Bipartisan Support Seals Fate of TikTok with Congressional Bill Passage""

Will India conduct a military intervention against Pakistan before the 2024 Indian general elections?,https://manifold.markets/MetaculusBot/will-india-conduct-a-military-inter,yORYjfDfnWmaA2hYHzwy,"From https://metaculus.com/questions/16420/india-acts-in-pakistan-by-2024-election/


At points, the Indian government has shown a tendency to use military operations around the time of important elections, possibly as a political strategy.


India has not declared a war on Pakistan, but the Indian government has executed two cross-border military operations in response to terrorist attacks, subsequently leveraging them as political tools to garner voter support. The first operation occurred in 2016 when India conducted ‘surgical strikes’ on terrorist camps in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, following the Uri attack that resulted in the deaths of 19 Indian soldiers. This event coincided with a critical state election in Uttar Pradesh, during which the ruling party campaigned on its tough stance against Pakistan. A similar move was repeated in 2019.


The second operation took place in 2019 when India launched an airstrike on a suspected militant training facility in Balakot, Pakistan, in response to a suicide bomber killing 40 Indian paramilitary personnel in Pulwama. This operation transpired during the general elections, and the ruling party once again emphasized its national security credentials while accusing the opposition of being soft on terrorism. These incidents suggest the possibility that India might initiate another military intervention against Pakistan before the next elections, particularly if faced with a similar provocation or a decline in popularity.


The next Indian general elections are expected to be held in April or May, 2024.",NO

Using similar criteria as Metaculus


Resolution Criteria


This question resolves Yes if, following the date of this question's publication and before close, credible reports indicate an attack attributed to Iran occurring within Israel's borders. The attack must additionally meet the following conditions for the question to resolve Yes:


Occur within the area demarcated as ""Israel"" on the Institute for the Study of War's map covering the 2023-2024 Israel-Gaza conflict. For the avoidance of doubt, an attack occuring within areas indicated as Gaza, the West Bank or the Golan Heights on the map will not be sufficient for a positive resolution. Israel's internal waters and territorial sea (the latter being Israel's sovereign waters up to 12 nautical miles from the shore) will be considered ""within Israel"" for the purposes of this question. More distant territorial waters beyond the territorial sea (e.g. contiguous zone, exclusive economic zone, etc.) will not be considered ""within Israel.""


Iran must either (i) explicitly acknowledge having carried out the attack via its armed forces or intelligence operatives or (ii) carry it out in such a manner that credible sources unambiguously attribute it to Iran's armed forces or intelligence operatives.


The attack must be kinetic, involving weaponry or physical force. Cyberattacks, even if resulting in fatalities, will not count towards the resolution of this question.",NO

I think this was good. 


Currently you can tip people for their comments, but it just sends them a managram and does not publicly signal that the good comment was rewarded. So personally I think they should go back to showing how much each comment has been tipped.


I have many other more complicated suggestions for comment incentives, but I think this is an easy win. Staff has seemed to be in favor of the idea when I've brought it up, but I understand there's a lot of other stuff to do too.

This resolves Yes as soon as one new Standup meeting is found -- share a screenshot and/or link if you want it to resolve, just in case it goes away.  Resolves No at closure if no new Standups were found.


Update: Apparently the meetings are generated as a template and only hidden when content starts rolling in.  


To resolve YES, the meeting must be shared in here in screenshot form with entries from at least two participants, not just a blank template.


Example: If Ian reports he is sick and won't attend, but the rest of the meeting is not public, that won't resolve Yes yet.


Example: If James reports something and Ian reports something and we can read that before the meeting is hidden, that will resolve Yes.",YES

Prediction Market Title:


""Will President Biden Call for Netanyahu's Resignation by April 30th, 2024?""


Introduction:


Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has publicly urged Israel to elect a new leader to replace Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, emphasizing the importance of this change for achieving a two-state solution and peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Schumer's call represents a significant political stance from a high-ranking U.S. official, raising questions about the U.S. administration's position. This prediction market aims to forecast whether President Joe Biden will echo Schumer's sentiment by calling for Netanyahu's resignation by April 30th, 2024.

""In a Shift, Biden Demands Netanyahu's Resignation to Facilitate Two-State Solution""


""White House Official Statement: Biden Seeks Netanyahu's Departure for Peace Efforts""


""Biden: 'Time for Netanyahu to Resign' to Advance Israeli-Palestinian Peace""


Example Edge Cases for NO Resolution:


""Biden Expresses Concerns Over Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, Stops Short of Demanding Netanyahu's Resignation""

""Biden Advocates for Dialogue in Israel, Does Not Call for Netanyahu's Departure""

Attack on Ukrainian cities or infrastructure at significantly higher volume than the previous ones (more than ~50 rockets in one day, please correct me in comments if this estimation is not correct)


Attack on any of the allies of Ukraine


The possible escalation has to be explicitly linked to the terrorist attack in an official statement of Russian president, Ministry of foreign affairs or a similar entity. An answer at a press conference counts. Speculations by Russian propagandists don't.

Alyssa Vance (Aug 29): Like GPT-4, Google's Gemini will, predictably, trigger a surge of public and government concern about advanced AI. It's good to prepare plans in advance so they can be launched in December or January


John Pressman (Dec 22): The prediction was a renewed wave of AI panic due to Gemini in December/January, I feel fairly confident saying that's not on the table except in so far as AI doomers are willing to hype anything that happens regardless if it scares people more.


Oliver Habryka (Dec 23): I agree that it's unlikely, though curious about your probabilities. I assign 10%-20% chance that the full Gemini does indeed come out in January and that we will see a large reaction to it (Polymarket is at 78% that it will be released before end of January).


This will resolve 60 days after the public gets access to Gemini Ultra, or earlier (without bothering to poll) if the answer is clear. If it is unclear, 60 days after release I will poll.

Same as these market, but with with a close date at the end of April (a month later).


Yes, the Singaporean government has actually sent Manifold an email asking about that, see the Thursday standup meeting for more info.


Here's the email they received, according to Manifold (I suspect some parts are comments from Manifold, but I'm not too sure):


We are a team from Open Government Products (https://www.open.gov.sg/), a unit of the Singapore government that builds products for the public good.


We are trying to jumpstart prediction markets in Singapore and our goal is to find an initial, small-scale use case, prove its success, and gradually scale it up. We are doing this as part of our hackathon, during which our business-as-usual work is suspended for a month and we can explore new product ideas.


We hope to work with Manifold to demonstrate that Manifold markets is capable of accurately predicting answers to questions that Singaporean policymakers are interested in. The hope is, having done this, it would be easier to persuade agencies to deepen their involvement with us. My colleagues and I are willing to put up our own money for this proof of concept.


Specifically, we would like to check with Manifold:


How can we ensure that the questions we post will garner sufficient interest from the community?


How much money should we put up to achieve this and what are the exact mechanics to do so?


What would a reasonable timeline look like? (Our demo day is on 1 Feb, so ideally we would like to achieve some results before that)


Preliminarily, we have identified the following metrics as good candidates to create a market in:


Housing data


Resale flat prices (published daily): https://beta.data.gov.sg/collections/189/datasets/d_8b84c4ee58e3cfc0ece0d773c8ca6abc/view


Market rental rates of flats (published monthly): https://beta.data.gov.sg/collections/166/view


Property transactions records (published daily): https://beta.data.gov.sg/collections/55/view


COVID-related data (published weekly): https://beta.data.gov.sg/collections/522/view


We were advised that it's probably in bad taste to create a market on the number of COVID-19 deaths, but the rest should be fine.


Separately, I wonder if Manifold has tried building something closer to an actual futures market, where the ""market price"" reflects the best estimate of a continuous variable that the market is trying to predict (need not be price, could be e.g. total fertility rate or COVID numbers or housing transaction volumes). I understand this could be achieved somewhat right now by using multiple choice where the values are bucketed, but the idea is to have a headline figure that directly predicts what the most likely outcome and could fluctuate like stock prices — this seems most useful for decision-makers.

Will resolve YES if The Verge federates any part of the site through ActivityPub before May 1, 2024. The launch must come with a commitment to a semi-permanent feature. Launching a feature ""in beta"" is fine if it's a continual integration of any aspect of the site, but federating a few quickposts or a single liveblog as a test would not be enough to resolve YES.

For the purpose of this question, it doesn't matter if the weights are officially released by Stability AI or leaked in some way.

Will there be a recount in the CA-16 Congressional Primary?,https://manifold.markets/Joshua/will-there-be-a-season-of-leagues-w,Jz4HX7AzaxvESZ6YA0tG,"Masters league is crazy! Fifty people all thrown into a single league, and only ten of them will win prizes!


This season it looks like the highest scoring person who demoted in Masters (position #26 w/ ~7k mana earned) would have been promoted in 75% of this season's diamond leagues!


This leads to a lot of people not wanting to be in Masters, and some even purposefully demoting. Why stay in Masters at #25 and get no prize when you could demote and next season win 1600 mana being #1 in Diamond?


Plus I hear there are plans for cohort vs cohort league competition, which I think is a great idea but doesn't work for anyone in Masters if there's only one Masters cohort.


Resolves YES if there is a season where the top league division has multiple cohorts, and there is no promotion to a higher league that doesn't exist at the time. So this doesn't resolve yes just because they introduce a single ""Grandmasters"" league and split up Masters to determine promotion to it.


Ideally, I think there should be multiple masters leagues and then site-wide weekly/monthly leaderboards like there used to be. But those ideas don't impact this market.

Buyers will have a chance to buy a bottle (actually, the lot generously includes two) of this famous wine for themselves at an upcoming Christie's auction. Link: 


LE GAVROCHE PART II: THE WINE CELLAR: Lot 71, Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, Romanée-Conti 2007


The pre-auction estimate is GBP 20,000 - GBP 30,000 (i.e. roughly $25K - $37K in USD). This market resolves YES if the final sale price listed on the Phillips website is >$40,000 USD. 


Resolution details


Example from a past auction: these bottles of Domaine Armand Rousseau, Chambertin 2015 list ""Price realised HKD 275,000"". This is the equivalent number I will use.


This final listed sale price will likely include a buyer's premium.


If the lot is withdrawn before the auction, or it fails to sell, this market resolves NO. It only resolves YES with a listed sale price during this auction of >$40,000.


The sale price will likely be reported in GBP. If Phillips directly reports a USD price, I will use that, otherwise I will use the Yahoo currency converter on the day I resolve the market.


For reference, at the time of market creation, it would take >31,894 GBP to surpass $40,000 USD.
